- Hi, I’m Alexandar Zapryanov
- I’m interested in learning new technologies, expanding my knowledge and gaining experience in all aspects of programming.
- I’m currently practicing my skills in Java and learning Spring and JavaScript.
- Also I am actively searching for an opportunity to start my professional journey in the magnificent world of technology as an intern or junior.
- The most important thing for me, at this point, is to work for a company whose core values and culture align well with me.
