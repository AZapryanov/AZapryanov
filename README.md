- Hi, I’m Alexandar Zapryanov
- I’m currently practicing my skills in Java and learning Spring and JavaScript.
- Also, I am eager to begin my professional journey in the magnificent world of technology.
- The most important thing for me, at this point, is that my own values and work ethic align well with the mission and the core values of the company that I will be working for.
